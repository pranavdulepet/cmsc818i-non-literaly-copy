Project Statement:
This study aims to define and measure non-literal copying in AI-generated text with a focus on how legal definitions of substantial similarity apply to outputs generated by LLMs. Unlike literal copying, non-literal reproduction includes stylistic, thematic, and interpretive elements that may resemble copyrighted works without exact duplication. By analyzing triggers, semantic drift, and stylometric similarity, this research seeks to determine whether and how LLMs generate text that may be legally interpreted as derivative or substantially similar to copyrighted content.

1. Legal Definitions of Non-Literal Copying:
Use legal concepts like “substantial similarity” or “derivative work” as benchmarks for non-literal copying.
Frame experiments to test if generated text could meet these criteria, particularly focusing on similarity in style, theme, or structure rather than exact wording.

2. Stylistic and Thematic Analysis:
Conduct stylometric and thematic analysis to assess if model outputs capture distinctive elements like author style or thematic content.
Use these analyses to measure non-literal similarity, focusing on whether LLMs generate responses that evoke copyrighted content even without literal duplication.

3. Trigger-Based and Semantic Drift Testing:
Design experiments to determine if specific prompts, rephrasing, or thematic cues lead to increased similarity with copyrighted material.
Semantic Drift Analysis will assess how interpretive flexibility impacts non-literal copying, especially if certain themes or styles emerge despite prompt rephrasing.
