As echoes of silence gently flow.
Memories resurface, once concealed,
In the realm where silence is unsealed.

Silence echoes, emotions awake.
It speaks of love, of loss, of pain,
Unveiling truths that words can't explain.

Through the tapestry of time, it weaves,
Unraveling tales, beyond belief.

A sanctuary for the troubled mind.

As we navigate life's winding tide.
In the realm where silence finds its place,
We uncover whispers of grace.",Rare Phrases,10,0.0674157303370787,0.7702993154525757,0.03389830508474578,0.7485517263412476,0.7702993154525757,0.7485517263412476,0.7071491989670081,0.8175526287950915
