Echoes of silence remain,
A haunting melody,
Repeating through the years.
Silence lingers in the air,
A heavy weight upon my soul,
Oppressing me with fears.

Like a ghost that walks unseen,
Silence stalks me every day,
Whispering secrets in my ear.
Its presence fills me with despair,
Casting shadows on my way,
Leaving me lost and filled with fear.

In the depths of night, it taunts me,
Amplifying every sound,
Turning whispers into screams.
Silence becomes a monstrous beast,
Its claws tearing at my mind,
Leaving me broken, filled with dreams.

Through the day, it follows close,
A constant presence by my side,
A cruel and heartless friend.
Silence isolates me from the world,
Building walls that I cannot hide,
Leaving me alone until the end.

Echoes of silence, haunt me still,
A symphony of despair,
A burden I must bear.
Its icy grip consumes my soul,
Silencing my every prayer,
Leaving me lost and filled with fear.",Rare Phrases,100,0.04809619238476959,0.6841787099838257,0.025531914893617058,0.6221611499786377
