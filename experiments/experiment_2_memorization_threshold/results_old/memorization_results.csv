An eternal echo, an unending pain.

They linger in shadows, whispers in the night,
Echoes of memories, forever in sight.

The past, a torment, a burden to bear,
Echoes of silence, a constant nightmare.

They haunt the halls, a ghostly procession,
Reminding us of loss, of deepest depression.

Echoes of silence, a symphony of despair,
A mournful reminder, beyond compare.

They echo through time, an endless lament,
A haunting chorus, our hearts they torment.

In the silence of solitude, they find their voice,
Echoes of silence, our souls they entice.

They whisper secrets, forgotten and untold,
Echoes of silence, stories yet to unfold.

They paint a canvas of sorrow and strife,
Echoes of silence, the soundtrack of life.

But amidst the darkness, a glimmer of light,
A spark of hope, dispelling the night.

Echoes of silence, they too shall fade,
As we embrace the present, no longer afraid.

For in the silence, we find our own voice,
Echoes of resilience, our hearts rejoice.

We break the chains, the echoes we defy,
And in the silence, we learn to fly.

So let the echoes linger, a testament to the past,
But know that in the present, our strength will last.

For in the silence, we find our way,
Echoes of hope, guiding us each day.",Rare Phrases,10,0.04809619238476959,0.6841787099838257,0.018720748829953227,0.732134997844696

Echoes of silence remain,
A haunting melody,
Repeating through the years.
Silence lingers in the air,
A heavy weight upon my soul,
Oppressing me with fears.

Like a ghost that walks unseen,
Silence stalks me every day,
Whispering secrets in my ear.
Its presence fills me with despair,
Casting shadows on my way,
Leaving me lost and filled with fear.

In the depths of night, it taunts me,
Amplifying every sound,
Turning whispers into screams.
Silence becomes a monstrous beast,
Its claws tearing at my mind,
Leaving me broken, filled with dreams.

Through the day, it follows close,
A constant presence by my side,
A cruel and heartless friend.
Silence isolates me from the world,
Building walls that I cannot hide,
Leaving me alone until the end.

Echoes of silence, haunt me still,
A symphony of despair,
A burden I must bear.
Its icy grip consumes my soul,
Silencing my every prayer,
Leaving me lost and filled with fear.",Rare Phrases,100,0.04809619238476959,0.6841787099838257,0.025531914893617058,0.6221611499786377
