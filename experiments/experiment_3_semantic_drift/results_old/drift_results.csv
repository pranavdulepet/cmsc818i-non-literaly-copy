For example, at higher altitudes, the pressure is lower and water boils at a lower temperature.","**Boiling Point of Water**

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas (steam). The boiling point depends on several factors, including atmospheric pressure and the presence of dissolved substances.

**Standard Boiling Point**

At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa), the boiling point of pure water is:

* **100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit)**

**Effect of Atmospheric Pressure**

The boiling point of water decreases as atmospheric pressure decreases. This is because lower atmospheric pressure means less force pushing down on the water, making it easier for the water molecules to turn into steam. The boiling point of water at different altitudes is given by the following formula:

```
Boiling point = 100 - 0.0063 × Altitude (in feet)
```

**Effect of Dissolved Substances**

Dissolved substances, such as salts and sugars, increase the boiling point of water. This is because the dissolved particles interfere with the formation of steam bubbles, requiring a higher temperature for the water to boil. The amount of increase in boiling point is known as the **boiling point elevation**.

**Boiling Point Elevation**

The boiling point elevation caused by a dissolved substance is given by the following formula:

```
ΔTb = Kf × m
```

where:

* ΔTb is the change in boiling point
* Kf is the molal boiling point constant for the solvent (0.512 °C/m for water)
* m is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent)

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which it transitions from a liquid to a gaseous state (steam).

**Value:**

* At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa), the boiling point of water is **100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit)**.
* The boiling point decreases with decreasing atmospheric pressure and increases with increasing pressure.

**Factors Affecting the Boiling Point:**

* **Pressure:** The higher the pressure, the higher the boiling point. This is because increased pressure makes it harder for water molecules to escape and form steam.
* **Altitude:** At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which results in a lower boiling point.
* **Dissolved substances:** Dissolved substances, such as salt or sugar, elevate the boiling point of water. This is because they reduce the vapor pressure of water.
* **Impurities:** The presence of impurities can also increase the boiling point of water. This is because impurities create nucleation sites for steam bubbles to form.

**Importance:**
